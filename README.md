I’m Nai, an aspiring security analyst with a passion for learning and exploring the world of cybersecurity. Currently, I’m focused on building my skills in security analysis, including risk assessments, vulnerability testing, and understanding threat landscapes.

While I haven’t yet developed an app, I’m excited about diving into the world of security to help protect systems and data from potential threats. I’m always open to learning from others and growing in this dynamic field!
